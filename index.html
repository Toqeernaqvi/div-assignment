        <p>For workers to engage and not just comply, they need some freedom and self direction.</p>

        <h1>Mastery</h1>
        <img src="./img/mastery.jpg" alt="mastery">
        <p>Getting better at something gives people a sense of accomplishment and sometimes, the satisfaction of being a
            leader in their field.</p>

        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <img src="./img/purpose.jpg" alt="purpose">
        <p>People are fueled by passion, so they need to believe that what they're doing has some sort of transcendent
            purpose. This is how Steve Jobs convinced a Pepsi Co. executive to work for Apple - because Jobs said they
            were going to 'change the world'.</p>
